# About plxl
I enjoy creating tools and building apps, with a focus on full-stack development, design, readability, and user experience. Here are some of my favourites:
- [MPEGUI](https://github.com/plxl/mpegui): An easy ffmpeg GUI to encode videos for online distribution or better storage
- [DTM Visualiser](https://github.com/plxl/dtm-visualiser): A tech demo that can seemlessly visualise TAS inputs with Dolphin frame outputs
- [Pikcards](https://github.com/plxl/Pikcards) and [Pikcards Bot](https://github.com/plxl/pikcards-bot): A work-in-progress Pikmin card game with a robust ruleset and Discord bot companion

### Home Server
I currently have two home servers; one I use exclusively for Home Assistant, and another as an all-rounder running Proxmox. Here are some of the services I use:
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) (and [Home Assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow))
- Debian file server (NAS)
- [OpenVPN](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install)
- [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole)
- [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)
- [Apache2](https://github.com/apache/httpd) (my [personal website](https://plxl.ddns.net))
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) (my [Discord.js bot](https://github.com/plxl/pikcards-bot))
